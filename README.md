### Gameplay instructions

The goal in the game is to knock the enemy pawns off the screen and get as high of a score as possible
The difficulty keeps increasing every level (how aggressive they are) and every fifth level there is more enemies.

There is a green powerup for you to pick up and increase your max launch speed, but be careful not to launch yourself out!
Also, pick up the yellow coins for more score if you dare, one spawns per level behind the enemies close to the edge.
Can you beat my score of 14?!  It takes patience and mastering the launching to get high score! Good luck!
